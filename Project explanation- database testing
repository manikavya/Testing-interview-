Certainly! Here are real-world examples for Database Testing in Web UI applications:
1. User Authentication and Account Management
Scenario: Testing the database operations related to user authentication, registration, and account management (e.g., creating a new user, updating user details, password reset).
	• Test Steps: 
		1. New User Registration: Insert a new user record into the database and ensure that all fields are correctly stored (e.g., username, email, hashed password).
		2. Login Verification: Retrieve a user's data from the database (based on the entered username) and verify that the hashed password matches.
		3. Update User Information: After updating the user's profile (e.g., change email or password), ensure that the changes reflect correctly in the database.
		4. Delete User: Ensure that a deleted user is completely removed from the database and that no data is left behind.
Real-World Example: In an online banking application, when a user logs in or registers, the Web UI interacts with the database to check and store the user's credentials. On password reset, the system updates the database with a new password.
2. Product Inventory Management
Scenario: Testing database queries and operations related to product inventory in e-commerce platforms.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Product Addition: Insert a new product into the database and verify that it appears in the inventory list with correct details (name, price, stock quantity).
		2. Product Stock Update: Test when a product is purchased or restocked, ensure that the database updates the stock quantity correctly.
		3. Product Deletion: Test deleting a product and ensure that it is removed from the database and the inventory listing.
		4. Search Product: Test product search functionality by querying the database with product name or category and verifying the result.
Real-World Example: In an e-commerce platform like Amazon, when a customer places an order, the inventory database is updated to reflect the change in stock. The product details are also pulled from the database for display on the UI.
3. Order Processing
Scenario: Verifying the database operations related to order processing in an e-commerce application or any order-based system.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Create Order: Insert a new order record into the database with relevant details like order ID, user ID, product IDs, quantity, and order status.
		2. Order Status Update: After processing the order (e.g., shipping, delivered), ensure that the order status is updated correctly in the database.
		3. View Order: Test fetching order details from the database to ensure that the correct data is returned to the Web UI (order ID, items, total cost, etc.).
		4. Cancel Order: Test the cancellation of an order and verify that the order status is correctly marked as “Cancelled” and inventory is updated accordingly.
Real-World Example: In platforms like eBay or Shopify, when a customer places an order, the Web UI communicates with the database to store the order information, update stock quantities, and manage payment statuses.
4. Payment Transactions
Scenario: Verifying payment-related operations and their integrity in the database.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Payment Details: Verify that the payment gateway or API stores transaction details correctly in the database (amount, payment method, user ID, transaction status).
		2. Payment Success/Failure: After a transaction, ensure that the database reflects the correct payment status (success or failure).
		3. Refund Process: Test if a refund is processed and stored correctly in the database, including the amount refunded, transaction ID, and user details.
		4. Transaction History: Verify that all completed transactions are recorded in the database, and the correct data is returned when querying a user's transaction history.
Real-World Example: On platforms like PayPal or Stripe, when users make payments or request refunds, the system updates the transaction details in the database, and the Web UI reflects those changes.
5. User Activity Logs
Scenario: Verifying that user activities are logged correctly in the database, such as login attempts, purchases, and other actions.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Log In Attempt: Verify that login attempts are logged in the database with relevant information (e.g., username, timestamp, success or failure).
		2. Transaction Log: After a user performs a transaction (e.g., buying a product), ensure that the transaction is logged in the activity database with appropriate details.
		3. Activity Search: Test fetching the logs for a user from the database to verify that the Web UI correctly displays the user’s activity history.
		4. Log Cleanup: Ensure that old logs are purged based on retention policies (e.g., logs older than 30 days are deleted).
Real-World Example: On banking or payment platforms like PayPal, user activities such as login, money transfer, and account changes are logged to help trace back any issues or fraudulent activity.
6. Email Verification
Scenario: Verifying that the database stores email verification statuses correctly when a user signs up or changes their email.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Send Verification Email: Insert a new user record into the database and check if the email_verified field is initially set to false.
		2. Email Verification: After the user clicks on the verification link, update the email_verified field to true in the database and ensure the Web UI reflects the change.
		3. Invalid Email: Test entering an invalid email address, and ensure that the database does not insert the data until the email is valid.
Real-World Example: When registering on a website, a user is sent a verification email. The database holds a flag to indicate whether the user has completed the verification process.
7. Session Management
Scenario: Verifying that session data is stored and managed properly in the database, especially for user login sessions.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Session Start: After a user logs in, ensure that a session record is created in the database with relevant details (e.g., session ID, user ID, login time).
		2. Session Expiry: Ensure that after a specified session timeout, the session record is expired or deleted from the database.
		3. Session Validation: During user actions, validate that the session ID in the request matches the one stored in the database, ensuring that the user session is valid.
Real-World Example: On a shopping site like Amazon, when a user logs in, a session ID is created in the database. The session is deleted or marked as expired when the user logs out or after a certain inactivity period.
8. Cart Management
Scenario: Verifying the functionality of the shopping cart in an e-commerce platform, ensuring that products are added, updated, and removed from the cart correctly in the database.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Add Item to Cart: When a user adds an item to the cart, verify that the item is correctly inserted into the cart database with the product ID, quantity, and price.
		2. Update Item Quantity: Test updating the quantity of an item in the cart and ensure that the database reflects the change (quantity and total price).
		3. Remove Item from Cart: Test removing an item from the cart and ensure that the item is deleted from the cart database.
Real-World Example: On platforms like Walmart, when a customer adds items to the shopping cart, the system stores these items in the database until the customer proceeds to checkout.
9. Database Integrity and Foreign Key Constraints
Scenario: Verifying that relationships between tables (e.g., user and order tables) are correctly enforced in the database using foreign key constraints.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Check Foreign Key: Verify that the database correctly enforces foreign key constraints. For example, ensure that an order can only be inserted if the user ID exists in the users table.
		2. Referential Integrity: Test deleting a user and ensure that all their related orders are either deleted or set to null, based on the defined referential integrity (ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE SET NULL).
		3. Insert Invalid Data: Attempt to insert data that violates foreign key constraints (e.g., inserting an order with a non-existing user ID) and verify that the database rejects it.
Real-World Example: In a relational database for an online store, each order record is linked to a user ID. If the user is deleted, their orders should either be removed or marked as orphaned based on the database constraints.
10. Performance Testing (Database Query Performance)
Scenario: Ensuring that database queries return results quickly and efficiently, especially for large datasets.
	• Test Steps: 
		1. Query Performance: Test querying the database for large sets of data (e.g., fetching all products or orders) and verify that the query execution time is within acceptable limits.
		2. Indexing: Test database queries on indexed columns and ensure that they execute faster than on non-indexed columns.
		3. Database Load: Simulate multiple simultaneous database connections and ensure that the system handles the load effectively without significant degradation in performance.
Real-World Example: In large e-commerce websites like Flipkart, when querying the database for product listings, proper indexing and optimized queries are necessary to fetch results quickly even with millions of products.
Conclusion:
Database testing is crucial to ensure that all operations such as user management, order processing, transaction history, product updates, and many other application features are accurately stored, retrieved, and updated in the database. It also ensures data integrity, performance, and the correct functioning of relationships between tables. In Web UI applications, the database plays an integral role in enabling smooth operations and offering real-time and reliable data for user interactions.
